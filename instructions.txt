Universal Effective VR Headset Field of View Tester
Developed by Phr00t's Software (www.phr00t.com)
------------------------------------------------------

* Requires Java 8 & SteamVR.

1) Make sure your headset is on, properly fitted, and
being recognized by SteamVR.

2) Run VR-HMD-FOVTester.jar with Java.

3) Look at the small floating box with a target, the
degree numbers should be very small when doing so. The
center of the target is the measurement point.

4) You will want to measure both the left to right
field of view, and the top to bottom seperately.

5) Turn your head to the right, until you can't see
the center of the target anymore on your left. You can
swivel your eyes & try your best to see it -- we are
trying to determine when the headset can't show you the
target's center anymore.

6) The "Deg FOV X:" number will be the "center to left"
field of view. You need to repeat this process by
turning your head to the left, and measuring when the
target's center is no longer visible on the right. You
will get another "Deg FOV X:" number.

7) Add the two numbers together. This will give you the
horizontal range field of view of your headset.

8) Repeat the whole process, but instead of turning left
& right, turn your head up & down. This will give you the
vertical range field of view of your headset (using the
"Deg FOV Y:" numbers).
